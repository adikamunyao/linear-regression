# Train and evaluate regression models

Models to practise linear regression algorithim.

Regression works by establishing a relationship between variables in the data that represent characteristics of the thing being observed (known as the features) and the variable to predict (known as the label).
Regression analysis is a method of mathematically determining which of those variables has an effect. It provides answers to the questions:
Which factors are most important?
Which of these can we disregard? 
How do those variables interact? 
How certain are we that all of these variables are correct?


We will create several models, ranging from simple to complex, using the regression algorithm, and then compare the performance of each model.

# PRIMARY PROJECT IDEA
prediction of start-up returns

## problem statement

start-ups have become very common in the modern economy. This project is aimed at building a model that will help predict the expected returns of a particular start-up. Start-up returns very from one start-up to another. Some of the profits are high while others are low. This research is aimed at building a regression model that takes into account the business sensitive factors that influence start-up returns. In our model we use a multiple regression model to test for the significance if our business sensitive factors  ;R&D spend, administration, marketing spend and state in explaining the profit margin in a start-up.


## Study Objectives

The main objective of this study is to model start-up returns using the multiple regression model; case study 50 start-ups in new york, California and Florida.

### The specific objectives are:

To test the significance of out business sensitive factors on start-ups returns.

To fit a multiple regression model using the factors that prove to be significant.

To give the accuracy of our model using MAE and MSE.

To give recommendations based on our model outcomes.


## Data

### Research Hypothesis

To accomplish the objectives of the study and provide solutions to the research question, the following hypothesis are formulated in their respective null forms:
H01: R&D Spend does not significantly affect start-up returns.
H02: Administration does not significantly affect start-up returns.
H03: Marketing Spend does not significantly affect start-up returns.
H04: State does not significantly affect start-up returns.


### Metric for Success
The best performing model will be selected based on the lowest Mean Absolute Error.
Defining the Research Question
We will build a multiple regression model to predict the profits of a start-up
